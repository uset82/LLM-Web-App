# Building LLM Applications Course

## About This Repository
This repository hosts a comprehensive course on developing applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). Initially, an attempt was made to create this course using Devin AI, which cost $50 but resulted in recursive loops without producing a complete project. This led to the current human-curated approach.

## Current Implementation
- Structured course outline completed
- Daily content templates established
- Week 1-2 materials drafted
- Core concepts and practical exercises in development
- Interactive components pending implementation

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`)
5. Create a Pull Request

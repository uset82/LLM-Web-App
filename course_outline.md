# Building LLM Applications for Data Scientists and Software Engineers
## A Production-Grade Approach to Large Language Model Development

### Course Overview
This intensive 4-week course bridges the gap between proof-of-concept LLM applications and production-ready AI systems. Using Modal for deployment and ChatGPT for practical demonstrations, participants will learn to build, evaluate, and deploy robust LLM applications that scale.

**Course Perks:**
- $1,000 in Modal API credits for hands-on development
- Lifetime access to course materials and recordings
- Certificate of completion
- Maven's 14-day satisfaction guarantee

### Rationale & Objectives
Many teams find themselves stuck in "POC purgatory" - able to create impressive demos but struggling to transform them into production-ready systems. This challenge stems from the unique characteristics of LLM applications, including:
- Non-deterministic outputs requiring robust evaluation frameworks
- Complex deployment requirements for efficient scaling
- Need for continuous monitoring and feedback loops
- Rapid evolution of underlying models and best practices

By December 2024, the field has evolved beyond simple scaling approaches, with companies like OpenAI, Google, and NVIDIA focusing on architectural innovations and efficient training methods. This course incorporates these latest developments to teach practical, production-ready approaches.

**Learning Outcomes:**
Participants will:
1. Master the end-to-end lifecycle of LLM application development
2. Implement robust evaluation and monitoring systems
3. Deploy scalable, production-grade LLM applications
4. Develop expertise in prompt engineering and model optimization
5. Create maintainable and efficient AI systems

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental architecture and components of Large Language Models
2. Implement production-grade LLM applications using Modal and OpenAI APIs
3. Design robust prompt engineering strategies for consistent outputs
4. Deploy scalable PDF processing systems with proper error handling

## Key Topics

### Introduction to Generative AI
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, enabling sophisticated text generation and understanding capabilities (Brown et al., 2020). This section covers:

- Evolution of language models and transformer architecture
- Key breakthroughs in scaling laws and model capabilities
- Understanding non-deterministic behavior in AI systems

### Production-Grade LLM Development
Building production systems requires careful consideration of:

```python
from modal import Image, Stub, web_endpoint
from openai import OpenAI

stub = Stub("llm-pdf-processor")
image = Image.debian_slim().pip_install(["openai", "pypdf"])

@stub.function()
@web_endpoint()
async def process_pdf(pdf_content: bytes) -> dict:
    """
    Production-ready PDF processing with proper error handling
    and API integration
    """
    try:
        # Initialize OpenAI client with proper error handling
        client = OpenAI()
        
        # Process PDF content
        # Add your PDF processing logic here
        
        return {"status": "success", "message": "PDF processed successfully"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
```
